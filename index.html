    <h2>Water imporatent</h2>
    <p>
      Around 60 percent of our body is made up of water and we can only live three to five days without fluids. Water plays many important roles in the body including flushing waste from the body, regulating body temperature, transportation of nutrients and is necessary for digestion.

    <h2>Waterfalls</h2>
    <p>
      Waterfalls purify the water as they flow into various rivers. Purification of water provides oxygen to various aquatic life forms, allowing them to thrive. So, without waterfalls and their purification of water, we wouldn't have any fish to eat, and other aquatic animals would perish, causing the Ecosystem to suffer.
